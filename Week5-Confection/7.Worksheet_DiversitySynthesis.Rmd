## OVERVIEW

In this worksheet, you will conduct exercises that reinforce fundamental concepts of biodiversity.
First, you will construct a site-by-species matrix by sampling confectionery taxa from a source community.
Second, you will make a preference-profile matrix, reflecting each student's favorite confectionery taxa. 
With this primary data structure, you will then answer questions and generate figures using tools from previous weeks, along with wrangling techniques that we learned about in class. 

## Directions:
1. In the Markdown version of this document in your cloned repo, change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) to your name.
2. Complete as much of the worksheet as possible during class.
3. Refer to previous handouts to help with developing of questions and writing of code.
4. Answer questions in the worksheet.
Space for your answer is provided in this document and indicated by the ">" character.
If you need a second paragraph be sure to start the first line with ">".
You should notice that the answer is highlighted in green by RStudio (color may vary if you changed the editor theme).
5. Before you leave the classroom, **push** this file to your GitHub repo.
6. For the assignment portion of the worksheet, follow the directions at the bottom of this file. 
7. When you are done, **Knit** the text and code into a PDF file.
8. After Knitting, submit the completed exercise by creating a **pull request** via GitHub.
Your pull request should include this file `7.DiversitySynthesis_Worskheet.Rmd` and the PDF output of `Knitr` (`DiversitySynthesis_Worskheet.pdf`).

## QUANTITATIVE CONFECTIONOLOGY

We will construct a site-by-species matrix using confectionery taxa (i.e, jelly beans). 
The instructors have created a **source community** with known abundance (*N*) and richness (*S*).
Like a real biological community, the species abundances are unevenly distributed such that a few jelly bean types are common while most are rare. 
Each student will sample the source community and bin their jelly beans into operational taxonomic units (OTUs).

## SAMPLING PROTOCOL: SITE-BY-SPECIES MATRIX

1. From the well-mixed source community, each student should take one Dixie Cup full of individuals.

2. At your desk, sort the jelly beans into different types (i.e., OTUs), and quantify the abundance of each OTU.  

3. Working with other students, merge data into a site-by-species matrix with dimensions equal to the number of students (rows) and taxa (columns)

4. Create a worksheet (e.g., Google sheet) and share the site-by-species matrix with the class. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "\\textbf{Left}: taxonomic key, \\textbf{Top right}: rank abundance distribution, \\textbf{Bottom right}: source community"}
knitr::include_graphics("data/jelly.png")
```

## SAMPLING PROTOCOL: PREFERENCE-PROFILE MATRIX

1. With your individual sample only, each student should choose their top 5-10 preferred taxa based on flavor, color, sheen, etc.

2. Working with other students, merge data into preference-profile incidence matrix where 1 = preferred and 0 = non-preferred taxa.

3. Create a worksheet (e.g., Google sheet) and share the preference-profile matrix with the class. 

### 1) R SETUP

In the R code chunk below, please provide the code to: 
1) Clear your R environment,
2) Print your current working directory,
3) Set your working directory to your `Week5-Confection/` folder, and
4) Load the `vegan` R package (be sure to install first if you have not already).

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
getwd()
setwd("/cloud/project/QB2025_Guevara/Week5-Confection")

package.list <- c('vegan', 'tidyverse', 'ggplot2', 'dplyr', 'broom')
for (package in package.list){
  if(!require(package, character.only = TRUE, quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(package)
  }
  library(c(package), character.only = TRUE)
}

data <- read.csv(file = "/cloud/project/QB2025_Guevara/Week5-Confection/data/jelly.source.comm.csv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)


```

## DATA ANALYSIS

**Question 1:** In the space below, generate a rarefaction plot for all samples of the source community. 
Based on these results, discuss how individual vs. collective sampling efforts capture the diversity of the source community.

```{r}
SbyS <- as.matrix(read.csv(file = "./data/JB_SbyS.csv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1))

S.obs <- function(x = "") { 
  rowSums(x > 0 ) * 1
  }

obs.SbyS <- S.obs(SbyS)
min.N <- min(rowSums(SbyS))
S.rarefy <- rarefy(x = SbyS, sample = min.N , se = TRUE)
rarecurve(x = SbyS, step = 20, col = "blue", cex = 0.6, las = 1) 
abline(0, 1, col = 'red')
text(1500, 1500, "1:1", pos = 2, col = 'red')
```

> ***Answer 1***:
> Having looked at the rarefaction plot, we can see the variation in how many species each of us actually end up with. We can see that this variation differs pretty strongly from the community number of species which is likely to be a more accurate representation of the species, or bean, diversity here. 


**Question 2:** Starting with the site-by-species matrix, visualize beta diversity.
In the code chunk below, conduct principal coordinates analyses (PCoA) using both an abundance- and incidence-based resemblance matrix.
Plot the sample scores in species space using different colors, symbols, or labels.
Which "species" are contributing the patterns in the ordinations?
How does the choice of resemblance matrix affect your interpretation?

```{r}
library(viridis)
### Constructing resemblance matrix based on species abundance
SbyS.db <- vegdist(t(SbyS), method = "bray")

### Constructing resemblance matrix based on preference/incidence. First I remove non-numeric columns and then remove cotton.candy column because it has missing value (i.e., "NA")

pref <- as.matrix(read_csv("/cloud/project/QB2025_Guevara/Week5-Confection/data/JB_preference.csv"))
pref <- pref[,c(-1,-15)]
pref <- na.omit(pref)  # Remove rows with NAs
pref <- as.data.frame(lapply(pref, function(x) as.numeric(as.character(x))))
pref <- pref[, colSums(pref) > 0]  # Remove all-zero columns

pref.dj <- vegdist(t(pref), method = "jaccard", binary = TRUE)

}

bean.pcoa.dj <- cmdscale(pref.dj, eig = TRUE, k = 3)
explainvar1 <- round(bean.pcoa.dj$eig[1]/sum(bean.pcoa.dj$eig), 3) * 100

# Generate distinct colors for each individual
num_individuals <- nrow(bean.pcoa.dj$points)
colors <- viridis(num_individuals)  # Generate unique colors

str(bean.pcoa.dj)  # Check the structure
dim(bean.pcoa.dj$points)  # Check dimensions
str(pref.dj)  # Check if it's a dist object
sum(is.na(pref.dj))  # Check if it contains NA values
k_value <- min(nrow(as.matrix(pref.dj)) - 1, 3)  # Ensure k is valid
bean.pcoa.dj <- cmdscale(pref.dj, eig = TRUE, k = k_value)

# Plot

     xlab = paste("PCoA 1 (", explainvar1, "%)", sep = ""),

}
```

> ***Answer 2***:
> I cannot seem to plot the incidence PCoA as the subscript seems to be out of bounds and I cannot seem to change the par to fix the issue. From the Bray-Curtis distance PCoA, we can't really see what is going on and which 'species' or jelly bean flavor is causing the greatest amount of variance in abundance. I can probably assume that the difference in which matrix we use would probably change our interpretation in terms of which species is causing the greatest amount of variation and from which person had the greatest variation in the abundances for each jelly bean species. 


**Question 3** Using the preference-profile matrix, determine the most popular jelly bean in the class using a control structure (e.g., for loop, if statement, function, etc).

```{r}
pref <- read_csv("/cloud/project/QB2025_Guevara/Week5-Confection/data/JB_preference.csv")
pref <- pref %>% rename(island.punch = `Island Punch`)

column_sums <- numeric(ncol(pref) - 1)  # Excluding the first column
column_names <- colnames(pref)[-1]  # Exclude the first column

# Loop through each numeric column (excluding the first one)
for (i in 2:ncol(pref)) {
  column_sums[i - 1] <- sum(pref[[i]])  # Store sum in vector
}

# Assign column names to the sums
names(column_sums) <- column_names

# Actually calculating column sums
pref.sums <- colSums(pref[, -1])

# Print results from the loop
print("Column sums calculated using a for loop:")
print(column_sums)
```

> ***Answer 3***:
> We can see that the most popular jelly bean in the class is the berryblue flavor. 


**Question 4**
In the code chunk below, identify the student in QB who has a preference-profile that is most like yours. 
Quantitatively, how similar are you to your "jelly buddy"?
Visualize the preference profiles of the class by creating a cluster dendogram.
Label each terminal node (a.k.a., tip or "leaf") with the student's name or initials.
Make some observations about the preference-profiles of the class. 


```{r}
pref <- as.matrix(read.csv(file = "./data/JB_preference.csv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1))

#Getting rid of missing values and replacing with zero
pref[is.na(pref)] <- 0

Bryan.distance <- pref["Bryan",]

similarities <- vegdist(rbind(Bryan.distance, pref), method = "jaccard")

# Extract the student with the lowest Jaccard distance (most similar) --> telling me who has the most similar preference profile based on row.
most_similar_student <- rownames(pref)[which.min(similarities[-1])]
print(most_similar_student)

# Compute Jaccard distance matrix
jaccard_distances <- vegdist(rbind(pref["Bryan", ], pref), method = "jaccard")

# Convert distance to similarity
jaccard_scores <- 1 - as.numeric(jaccard_distances)

# Remove self-comparison (Bryan.distance to Bryan.distance)
jaccard_scores <- jaccard_scores[-1]

# Find the most similar student
most_similar_index <- which.max(jaccard_scores)
most_similar_student <- rownames(pref)[most_similar_index]

# Get the Jaccard similarity score
jaccard_score <- jaccard_scores[most_similar_index]

# Print results
print(paste("Most similar student:", most_similar_student))
print(paste("Jaccard similarity score:", round(jaccard_score, 4)))

# Ensure pref is a numeric matrix (convert if necessary)
pref_matrix <- as.matrix(pref)

# Compute a distance matrix (default: Euclidean distance)
distance_matrix <- dist(pref_matrix, method = "euclidean")

# Perform hierarchical clustering
cluster <- hclust(distance_matrix, method = "ward.D2")

# Plot the dendrogram
plot(cluster)


```

> ***Answer 4***:
> It seems that Jocelyn has the most similar preference profile to mine. I seem to be something incorrectly seeing as the jaccard score that results from my code is stating that Jocelyn and I have a similarity score of 1 which does not seem possible. Based on this clustering method, it would seem that Elaine and I have the strongest similarity preference profile as opposed to what the jaccard was telling me that it was Jocelyn. In this case, Jocelyn even appears to be an outgroup as the next person who has the most similar preference profile to me being ElPark.
