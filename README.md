# QB2025_Guevara
Student QB repo for Bryan Guevara (brygueva@iu.edu)
To start, I am 2nd year PhD student in the EEB program. I am a member of the Lau lab. I have been practicing and learning the ukuelele for a couple months now to pick up as a side hobby. I enjoy spending time at the gym. Lately, I have been wanting to get into fishing so I think that will be something that I get up to later this summer. I also plan on improving my swimming endurance and speed in preparation for a triathalon later this year. I have been watching a lot of movies and TV shows, I have been binge watching The Big Bang Theory.
